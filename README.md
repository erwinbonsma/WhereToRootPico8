Where to Root?
==============

[Where to Root][] will become an area control game for the [PICO-8][] fantasy console.

Origin
------
The game is a spin-off of the Unity game [Where to Root (GGJ)][] which the team I was part of created during the 2023 [Global Game Jam][].
The theme of that jam was "root".

We created a multi-player game with trees and seeds.
The goal is to be the first player to have a tree in each of the target areas.

The game features the following basic mechanics:
- Trees grow and once fully grown disseminate seeds and disappear
- Seeds travel in a random direction and can take root to grow into a new tree
- Each player can only decide when to root each of their seeds
